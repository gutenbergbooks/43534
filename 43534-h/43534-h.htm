</div>

<p>Sit down! Sit down! Stop
right where you are! The
game isn't over by a long
way.</p>

<p>I've got a few aces up my
sleeve yet, and don't you forget
it!</p>

<p>No wonder I'm feeling tiptop!
Fact is, I fancy I am feeling
to-night a little like the colored
brother who got religion, and
filled with enthusiasm, or something more of a liquid
character, expressed to the doubting parson his desire
to imitate Elijah, and go to glory in a chariot of fire.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the parson, "I reckon, my friend, you'se
just want to get acclimated-like before reachin' de
end ob your journey."</p>

<p>Now how did that reverend gentleman know?</p>

<p>Why, only through circumstantial evidence, for you
see he had unfortunately once been the proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
owner of a flock of fowls that did
not have sense enough to roost
high.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 251px;">
<a href="images/i004large.jpg"><img src="images/i004.jpg" width="251" height="315" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>However, I'm not sighing just
yet to go to glory.</p>

<p>This gay metropolis pleases me
some.</p>

<p>But, talking of circumstantial evidence, I know
one man who would never consent to hang a suspected
murderer on the strength of it.</p>

<p>You won't blame him, either, when you hear what
his experience in that line has I been.</p>

<p>He's a doctor by profession.</p>

<p>His learning has always been in the direction of
mind troubles, and consequently I wasn't surprised
when I met him the other day to learn that he is
now in full charge of one of the biggest institutions
in the State, for the care of the insane.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that recently in making a tour
of inspection the doctor had occasion to enter an
unoccupied cell in the ward reserved for incurables.</p>

<p>As he did so the iron door clicked shut, making
him a prisoner in his own asylum.</p>

<p>While he was standing there, rattling the grating
and calling for an attendant, a party of visitors came
strolling his way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"I beg your pardon,"
said the doctor suavely
to the first man, "but
I'm locked in."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i005large.jpg"><img src="images/i005.jpg" width="400" height="554" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Poor fellow," replied
the visitor, "so I
perceive."</p>

<p>"I wish you would be good
enough to have some one let me
out," the doctor continued.</p>

<p>By this time a second visitor appeared.</p>

<p>"See," said the first, "this fellow looks quite intelligent,
and asks to be released, as though he
really expected it."</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, I see your error. I am not crazy, I
assure you. I locked myself in here by accident.
Really&mdash;I&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;" and the doctor felt himself
smiling in the most blankly imbecile manner.</p>

<p>"Look at him now!" cried the second
visitor. "Did you ever see a more hopelessly
idiotic expression on the face of
man?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 175px;">
<a href="images/i006large.jpg"><img src="images/i006.jpg" width="175" height="247" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>This was really too much for human
nature to endure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"See here, you scoundrels," cried the doctor, excitedly,
"call an attendant or I'll have you both in
here for life. I'm the superintendent."</p>

<p>"Come away," said one of the strangers, quickly,
"we musn't get the poor devil worked up. He may
do himself harm," and they passed on down the corridor.</p>

<p>The doctor spent a morning in that cell, and now
he says he has more sympathy for his patients.</p>

<p>He assured me that if I ever took a notion to
drop in and see him, he would do all he could to
make my stay comfortable.</p>

<p>I wonder what he meant, and if that was a mere
formula used to calm each new guest at his hotel.</p>

<p>Long experience has made the doctor quite an
artist in that line.</p>

<p>Speaking of artists, there's
Craigie, who has a studio on
Fifth Avenue. Craigie is a friend
of mine.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 270px;">
<a href="images/i007large.jpg"><img src="images/i007.jpg" width="270" height="477" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>He paints atrocious pictures,
but somehow seems to make a
living out of the business.</p>

<p>Sometimes I go to see him,
when business is bad, and I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
wondering where the money's coming from to pay
the month's bill.</p>

<p>Between you and myself, the sight of all those
daubs on the walls of his studio, which he considers
masterpieces, always makes me feel better.</p>

<p>Misery likes company, and they certainly do look
tough.</p>

<p>Recently, while I was lounging there in his Oriental
corner, old Dr. Gregg dropped in.</p>

<p>I expected some fun, because the doctor has
quite a caustic tongue, you know, and don't mind
giving a fellow a rap.</p>

<p>Craigie understood why I winked at him, and I
saw blood in his eye while he continued to paint.</p>

<p>The doctor walked around, grunting and making an
occasional slurring remark that in another man might
have been looked on as an insult.</p>

<p>But we all knew Gregg.</p>

<p>Finally he turned
to the artist.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i008large.jpg"><img src="images/i008.jpg" width="400" height="220" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"I say, Craigie,
these things which
you exhibit on your
walls, seeking a purchaser in vain, I suppose may be
called failures?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well," remarked the artist, "perhaps you hit the
nail on the head in a commercial sense, doctor. You
see, men in your profession have the advantage over
us poor devils of painters, for while we
are compelled to exhibit our failures on
the wall, yours are safely planted underground
out of sight."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 112px;">
<a href="images/i009large.jpg"><img src="images/i009.jpg" width="112" height="320" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>When I met Craigie, after he had spent
a summer abroad, he delighted me with his
sketches of the many interesting things he
had seen.</p>

<p>Among other subjects he had a picture of Monte
Carlo.</p>

<p>It is certainly a lovely heaven on earth and I said
as much. Craigie grinned at me.</p>

<p>"All the same," said he, "it has appeared to be a
regular hades for many a poor devil."</p>

<p>"That's so&mdash;when a fellow has lost all his money,"
I admitted.</p>

<p>"Why," said he, "I myself experienced the tortures
of the Inquisition in that room you see yonder."</p>

<p>"What are those affairs in sight?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I played roulette there, and was broken at the
wheel."</p>

<p>Although I never went through a similar experience
I could sympathize with Craigie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>Leaving out
the wheel part
of it, his condition
has usually
been a constitutional failing
of mine, and
was that morning
when I
called at the
office of the
Sunday paper.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i010large.jpg"><img src="images/i010.jpg" width="400" height="499" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Now, if there
is anything I dislike
it's to see an editor show his temper.</p>

<p>Some of them are really too provoking.</p>

<p>So when I happened in and found the man who
runs the comic supplement frothing at the mouth I
tried to soothe him.</p>

<p>"Christopher Columbus!" I remarked, pleasantly,
after my usual way, "you seem to be out of humor
this morning."</p>

<p>"That's all right," he snarled; "you can't sell me
any."</p>

<p>What a husband that bear must be; not domestic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
after my own fashion, for I
dearly love to do errands
for my wife.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 335px;">
<a href="images/i011large.jpg"><img src="images/i011.jpg" width="335" height="538" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Of course I sometimes
make blunders in shopping,
but then experience teaches
one, and in time I hope to be able to
hold my own with the tricky tradesmen
who look upon me as a soft
mark.</p>

<p>When the mistake is really atrocious
I get a good calling down, and
sometimes have to resort to strategy in order to
save the day.</p>

<p>The lady of the house was indignant this evening
when I came home from my weary round of the
newspaper offices.</p>

<p>"The joke is on you, George," she said.</p>

<p>I wondered which one, for the day had not been
productive of much long green.</p>

<p>"What's it all about?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why, that mattress I told you to buy."</p>

<p>"Well, I bought it all right," I protested, feebly.</p>

<p>"Yes, and instead of sending home a mattress of
live goose feathers, you purchased one of excelsior."</p>

<p>"How can you blame me, my dear," I said, "when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
I assure you it had a
placard fastened to it
which read 'Marked
Down'? That furniture
man is a prevaricator,
that's all."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i012large.jpg"><img src="images/i012.jpg" width="400" height="534" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Those sharks who
sell furniture must
have some connection
with fishermen, to
judge from the thundering
big lies they tell.</p>

<p>Now, I am fond of going fishing myself.</p>

<p>Perhaps I take a deeper interest in the whooping
big yarns spun around the blazing camp fire by a set
of jolly sportsmen than in the taking of mighty strings
of fish.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i013large.jpg"><img src="images/i013.jpg" width="400" height="240" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Still, I delight to lure
the festive trout out of
the wet.</p>

<p>I've met some fellows who like old-fashioned
methods, and succeed where
the rest with their expensive tackle fail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>One day I had a remarkable run of luck, and that
night as we sat around the camp fire, I took occasion
to say that my success was due to the superior
kind of flies I had used.</p>

<p>"You may flatter yourself on the string you've
brought in to-day," said an old fisherman who had
joined our party, "but let me tell you, mister, that I
saw a Digger Indian catch more fish in one hour in
this stream than you've landed all day with your fine
flies."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i014large.jpg"><img src="images/i014.jpg" width="400" height="334" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"What bait did he use?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Live grasshoppers,"
replied the old man;
"but he didn't impale
them. From his head
he would stoically
pluck a hair, and with
it bind the struggling
insect to the hook. Almost upon the instant that
this bait struck the water a fish would leap for it.
After landing him the Indian would calmly repeat
the performance of snatching a hair from his head
and affixing a fresh grasshopper to the hook.</p>

<p>"After the Indian had landed in quick succession a
mighty string of salmon trout he suddenly stopped.
I called to him to go on with the exciting sport, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
he merely smiled grimly and pointed significantly to
his head."</p>

<p>"What was the matter with his head?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He had plucked it bald," replied the old man.</p>

<p>There have been some occasions when I've felt
myself as though I would like to pluck my hair out,
though it is generally on account of some stupidity
on my part.</p>

<p>And if you don't mind I will tell you right here,
how.</p>

<p>I put my foot in it the other night.</p>

<p>I was so provoked at my stupidity that I came
near retiring to a nunnery, or taking a solemn vow
not to speak a single word for a week.</p>

<p>Now, I haven't an unusually large mouth, and yet
when I related my unfortunate break to Charlie
Parsons, the cashier of our bank, he
was cruel enough to hint that perhaps
some people never could open
their mouth without putting their foot
in it.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 187px;">
<a href="images/i015large.jpg"><img src="images/i015.jpg" width="187" height="223" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I call that decidedly uncharitable, don't you?</p>

<p>But about this stupid remark of mine.</p>

<p>It was a big reception you know, a mixed company,
where one was apt to meet any sort of an old star.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Some famous chaps were there, too.</p>

<p>I honored it with my presence.</p>

<p>At the table I chanced to sit next to a learned
professor, head of a famous college. And during
the meal some fiendish spirit induced me to turn
toward him and say:</p>

<p>"Professor, can you tell me who that uncommonly
ugly lady is, opposite to you?"</p>

<p>He looked at me
with a wicked smile.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, "she
chances to be my
wife."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 399px;">
<a href="images/i016large.jpg"><img src="images/i016.jpg" width="399" height="333" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Of course I was
overwhelmed with confusion,
and to crawl
out of the hole I did what any other person would
have done under the same circumstances.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, professor, but I mean the lady on
the right."</p>

<p>"And that, sir, is my daughter," he said, solemnly.</p>

<p>Then I flew the coop.</p>

<p>When I was strolling along the Bowery this evening
I saw a man come jumping out of a museum that
boasts of more freaks than Barnum's show.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 384px;">
<a href="images/i017large.jpg"><img src="images/i017.jpg" width="384" height="356" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Where's the nearest doctor?" he
cried, and from his frightened
appearance I felt
positive the human snake
had gulped down the
bearded lady, or the living skeleton with
the ossified bones wanted a tough joint
pulled, or had got stuck in the wastepipe
of the sink.</p>

<p>"What's the matter&mdash;anything wrong?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Wrong," he yelled, "I should say there was. Why,
the sword swallower has got a pin down his gullet!
Show me a doctor, quick!"</p>

<p>A little further along I saw an Irishman being run
out of a clothing store by an irate Jew, who certainly
looked as though he couldn't take a joke.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i018large.jpg"><img src="images/i018.jpg" width="400" height="396" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The Celt was
laughing when I
caught up with him.</p>

<p>"What's up?" I
asked.</p>

<p>He pointed to
the sign that read:</p>

<p>"Great Slaughter
in Clothing."</p>

<p>"Sure," said he, "the gossoon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
was mad clane through because I wint in and asked
to see one av thim kilt suits," and he laughed so
hard that he choked half to death over a set of
false teeth.</p>

<p>Speaking of teeth, that was pretty tough on Snyder
when his little son and heir took to giving away
family secrets so recklessly.</p>

<p>It seems that Snyder had been treating himself to
a new set of teeth.</p>

<p>The youngster thought the event of sufficient importance
to be related to the minister when he called.</p>

<p>And quite naturally the good dominie, much
amused, asked what would become of the old ones.</p>

<p>"Oh, I suppose," replied little James, with a look
of resignation; "they'll cut 'em down and make me
wear 'em."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i019large.jpg"><img src="images/i019.jpg" width="400" height="458" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Snyder's wife is a
good general.</p>

<p>She was riding in the
car with her little
daughter Edith, when
the conductor, thinking
perhaps of a half fare,
asked:</p>

<p>"How old are you, little girl?"</p>

<p>"You must ask ma," she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
immediately replied, "'cause she always takes care
of my age in a street car."</p>

<p>Now that was pretty cute, don't you think so?</p>

<p>And my youngest came up smiling recently.</p>

<p>Really, I am worried about that little chap, because
I never know whether he is going to be a fool
or a humorist.</p>

<p>Perhaps it doesn't matter much.</p>

<p>On this occasion he had had his first ride in an
automobile.</p>

<p>A fellow around the corner bought one recently,
and as he wants to get in my good graces for some
reason or other, he asked Harold to go through the
park with him.</p>

<p>That evening I heard my wife, who is very circumspect
in all such matters of etiquette, say:</p>

<p>"Harold, did you thank Mr. Gaycrank for that
lovely ride he gave you?"</p>

<p>Harold was reading but did not answer.</p>

<p>So she asked him again.</p>

<p>I knew he heard from the way he looked up, but
was surprised that he made no reply.</p>

<p>"Harold!" she spoke sharply, now.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma," he replied.</p>

<p>"Did you thank Mr. Gaycrank for taking you riding?
Why don't you answer me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did thank him, ma," whispered Harold, "but he
told me not to mention it."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 232px;">
<a href="images/i020large.jpg"><img src="images/i020.jpg" width="232" height="241" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Harold was studying geography.</p>

<p>I saw something puzzled him.</p>

<p>"What's the knotty problem?" I
asked him.</p>

<p>"They call the Mississippi the
'Father of waters,'" he said, "and
I think it ought to be the 'Mother of waters.'"</p>

<p>"Correct, my son," I said, admiringly.</p>

<p>"Is Missouri the daughter of Mississippi then?" he
asked.</p>

<p>I'm afraid I have much to answer for.</p>

<p>And think of it, that boy only nine years old.</p>

<p>What will become of us when he breaks loose at
man's estate?</p>

<p>Just this morning he astonished me by declaring
the dictionary was only an old joke book after all.</p>

<p>I frowned upon such levity.</p>

<p>The dictionary I look upon as an old and valued
friend, and one deserving of the utmost respect.</p>

<p>It has pulled me out of many a difficulty.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, I'll give you a dime for every bona fide
joke you show me in the dictionary," I said.</p>

<p>"All right, here's one already."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i021large.jpg"><img src="images/i021.jpg" width="400" height="381" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>He pointed out
the word "question."</p>

<p>Reading further I
found this:</p>

<p>"To pop the
question&mdash;see pop."</p>

<p>Well, I never begrudged
that dime a bit. And my
respect for that solemn
old conglomeration of knowledge is now mingled
with hilarity.</p>

<p>Since I'm in on the subject of young ones, let me
tell you that I've always endeavored to impress my
children with the fact that I take an interest in all
they do.</p>

<p>That is, I want them to come to me with all their
troubles, and gain by my checkered experience.</p>

<p>Sort of older brother confidence game, you know.</p>

<p>Once in a while I'm rather afraid they take advantage
of my easy-going character.</p>

<p>There's Aleck, about sixteen, and almost ready to
go to college&mdash;what d'ye think he said to me
yesterday.</p>

<p>Catching me in a particularly good frame of mind,
when a big check had just come in, he said in a serious
tone:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i022large.jpg"><img src="images/i022.jpg" width="400" height="298" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Will you advise
me, pop?"</p>

<p>"Certainly&mdash;only
too delighted,
my son. Now,
what is it you
want my opinion
upon?" I said,
feeling particularly pleased because of this confidence.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, I wanted to know whether I had
better strike you for five dollars or for ten?"</p>

<p>There's no use in telling you how much he got, for
who could resist such a clever hold up?</p>

<p>Oh, by the way, did I ever tell you about Jackman?</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 304px;">
<a href="images/i023large.jpg"><img src="images/i023.jpg" width="304" height="431" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Among my friends I suppose he is by long odds
the most consequential&mdash;why,
he has the strut of a Lord
High Admiral in a comic
opera.</p>

<p>That is, when before the
public.</p>

<p>Secretly, I believe he leads
a sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde life, and that the power behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the throne is in reality his wife, a little woman with
a will of her own.</p>

<p>This was proven to my mind the day I was out
with him at his country seat.</p>

<p>His coachman came up, looking red in the face,
as though out of
humor.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i024large.jpg"><img src="images/i024.jpg" width="400" height="486" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"I think I must
leave you, Mr. Jackman,"
said he.</p>

<p>"Why, what's wrong,
Thomas?"</p>

<p>"I don't like to complain, sir, but really
I can't stand the missus."</p>

<p>"Oh, is that it&mdash;she's too strict, eh?"
laughed Jackman.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, she keeps forgetting that I can throw
up my job at any time, and bosses me around just as
if I was you, sir."</p>

<p>I thought it good manners to get behind the stable
before I allowed myself to laugh.</p>

<p>But Thomas went all the same.</p>

<p>Jackman told me Thomas had recently got religion
and was about the longest-winded petitioner at prayer
he ever knew. But I had been South among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
darkies, and remembered one old fellow, at least, who
could give him points and still win out.</p>

<p>This was old Uncle Mose, who looked solemn
enough for a funeral when I asked him how things
were going.</p>

<p>"I declar'," he said, "I got ter be mo' keerful in
future&mdash;I sho' has!"</p>

<p>"What's the trouble now?" I asked.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 308px;">
<a href="images/i025large.jpg"><img src="images/i025.jpg" width="308" height="358" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Well, suh, I whirled in en
prayed fer rain dese two hours
en a half, en bless de Lawd,
dey come along a regular deluge,
dat mighty nigh drown de
bes' mule I had. Prov'dence
am so partial ter me, dat I'se
got ter be mo' keerful about
overdoin' things, you see."</p>

<p>Uncle Mose had a son who, being a barber, puts
on considerable style at times.</p>

<p>I'd seen him look like a howling swell.</p>

<p>One day, down at the post office, while waiting
for the mail to be distributed, I saw this Adolphus
saunter in.</p>

<p>Another young gamecock rubbed elbows with him.</p>

<p>"Hullo, 'Dolphus, you'se ain't been a wearin' dem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
fine patent-leather shoes ob yours no mo'. What
am de matter?" I heard him ask.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 294px;">
<a href="images/i026large.jpg"><img src="images/i026.jpg" width="294" height="559" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Kain't&mdash;de patent done run
out," said Adolphus.</p>

<p>That fellow was quite good
looking, and in fact I can remember
quite enjoying him
after a fashion.</p>

<p>I don't believe I've ever
been called a handsome man
myself.</p>

<p>That is, in a beauty show,
the prizes wouldn't be rushing
in my direction.</p>

<p>And yet for years I did cherish the fond belief
that my face had the stamp of honesty and rectitude
upon it.</p>

<p>Alas! I'm not so positive now.</p>

<p>To tell the plain, unvarnished truth, I begin to fear
this business of talking on humorous subjects is beginning
to leave its effect upon my frank countenance.</p>

<p>This is how I know.</p>

<p>I had engaged to do a stunt in a certain town
down among the North Carolina pines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Come to find out, there was no way of getting
there except by means of a stagecoach, just as in
olden days.</p>

<p>I was the only passenger, you see.</p>

<p>There had been considerable talk about a rascal
who had robbed right and left, so that I was not
feeling very good.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i027large.jpg"><img src="images/i027.jpg" width="400" height="403" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Besides, I
didn't like the
looks of that
driver, for if
ever an evil-browed
mountaineer
had taken
to coaching,
he was the man.</p>

<p>He kept looking
back at me
every little while, and somehow I got the notion into
my head that he was figuring whether it would pay
to make way with me.</p>

<p>There was an awful lonely stretch of woods between
Athens and Saulsboro, and when we struck it
I tell you a cold chill pranced up and down my spinal
column, for it was just an ideal spot for murder.</p>

<p>Suddenly the driver drew in his horses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>My knees began to knock together, and my teeth
rattled just like those Turkish castanets you've seen
dancers use.</p>

<p>The worst had come, and this black-browed villain
was about to finish me then and there.</p>

<p>I tried to get to my feet.</p>

<p>"Hold on there!" growled the driver.</p>

<p>His voice trembled, I thought, with rage.</p>

<p>It was the most terrible moment of my life.</p>

<p>"Who are ye?" he next demanded.</p>

<p>I told him my name.</p>

<p>"What ye going to Athens fur?" he asked.</p>

<p>I hastened to inform him that I was the funny
man who had been engaged to appear, my object
being to let him know I might be worth more coming
away from Athens than when bound there.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 376px;">
<a href="images/i028large.jpg"><img src="images/i028.jpg" width="376" height="270" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>He put out his big
hand, quickly.</p>

<p>I expected to see a
big pistol in it, but no, it
was empty.</p>

<p>"How glad I am, mister,
to hear that," he said. "I've
been shaking in my boots all this yer time thinkin' ye
was that land pirate an' meant to murder me, 'cause
they say he's even an uglier cuss than me. Shake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
hands, mister. I declar ye've taken a mighty big
load off'n my mind."</p>

<p>I shook hands with the delighted fellow, but lacked
the nerve to tell him how badly scared I had been.</p>

<p>But I'm not so proud of my honest looks nowadays.</p>

<p>Whenever I hear a good story in connection with
some person of note, I always enjoy it more if I
happen to know the party.</p>

<p>They told me about Richard Harding Davis the
other night at the club, which amused me not a little.</p>

<p>Ever hear of his adventures with the bull?</p>

<p>Well, it runs something like this, and those who
happen to be honored with a personal
acquaintance with the famous young
American author will appreciate its
point best.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i029large.jpg"><img src="images/i029.jpg" width="400" height="514" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>He was taking a stroll one day, and
lost in meditation, so
the story runs, rather
incautiously started
to cross a meadow
where a ferocious bull
was pastured.</p>

<p>The gentleman did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
not see the bull until he charged, and then like a
true soldier of fortune he dropped his dignity and
made headlong for the nearest fence.</p>

<p>This he reached in good time, but the bull had the
satisfaction of assisting him over.</p>

<p>Though no great damage was done, Mr. Davis'
feelings were deeply injured.</p>

<p>Just then, as luck would have it, the owner of the
bellowing bovine came running up.</p>

<p>He was angry because Mr. Davis had been trespassing
on his property, and Mr. Davis was mad
clean through because he was not in the habit of
being assisted over fences in that style.</p>

<p>"I'll have you arrested for trespass, sir," exclaimed
the farmer, in a rage.</p>

<p>"And I'll have you summoned for keeping dangerous
animals at large," cried Mr. Davis.</p>

<p>"You had no business on my land, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah! perhaps you don't know me; I'm Richard
Harding Davis, sir!" striking his well-known attitude,
and tapping his manly breast significantly.</p>

<p>"Oh," said the farmer, duly impressed, "but Mr.
Davis, why didn't you tell that to the bull?"</p>

<p>I was out in a country cemetery lately.</p>

<p>Ever walked through one?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes you find some queer epitaphs on the
old stones.</p>

<p>I read one that told about the virtues of three
husbands a certain woman had.</p>

<p>And the monument had evidently been touched up
several times, as occasion required.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 325px;">
<a href="images/i030large.jpg"><img src="images/i030.jpg" width="325" height="533" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>This gave me a suggestion
which I later carried out in the
shape of a little song, and if
you will permit me, I'll sing it
to you now. Keep your seats,
there's no extra charge.</p>

<p>The orchestra will please
play, softly, the "Dead March
of Saul." My song is entitled "The
Overworked Monument."</p>

<p>There's Cribber, for example, has
become quite infatuated over the
races, and loses no opportunity of
going when the season is on.</p>

<p>He stoutly maintains that it is just his Kentucky
love for the magnificent thoroughbreds that lures him
there.</p>

<p>And being a confiding sort of a fellow myself I
actually believed this song and dance for a time.</p>

<p>I know better now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>Here's where the bars were lowered.</p>

<p>Cribber has a lovely home, and a devoted wife,
who has long been one of my wife's best friends.</p>

<p>The other day when she was at the house she
took advantage of my wife running upstairs to get
her hat on, to put me on the rack.</p>

<p>I was surprised.</p>

<p>What do you think she asked me?</p>

<p>She wanted to know whether the air down on
Long Island had malaria in it, and especially around
Sheepshead Bay, where the horses ran.</p>

<p>I assured her that so far as I
knew it was considered fully as
healthy as any other part of the
shore.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i032large.jpg"><img src="images/i032.jpg" width="400" height="500" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Then she let the
cat out of the bag.</p>

<p>Several times of late after
Cribber had been to the races
he looked careworn and
cross, and complained that
there was something radically
wrong with his system.</p>

<p>I saw a great light.</p>

<p>But I made no attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
explain matters to the little woman, who doubtless
continues to be worried about the health of that gay
old deceiver, Cribber, and when I told him about it
he bribed me to secrecy with a prize fifty-cent cigar.</p>

<p>To tell you the truth, if
there's anything I enjoy it's a
prime cigar.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 304px;">
<a href="images/i033large.jpg"><img src="images/i033.jpg" width="304" height="294" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>And like many another man
I've had to make myself a martyr each
Christmas, for my better-half invariably
insists on buying me a box of the weeds.</p>

<p>Her intentions are all right, but the cigars&mdash;well,
they generally bring back vivid recollections of boyhood
days, when corn-silk and grape leaves all went.</p>

<p>I have come to dread the holiday time.</p>

<p>And yet I never have the heart to dissuade her,
she seems to take such delight in seeing me smoke
one of the vile weeds some villain of a tobacconist
sold her as prime stuff.</p>

<p>Now this year I determined to be wise.</p>

<p>Accordingly I managed to slip out of the house
and presented the box with a "Merry Christmas" to
Mike McGinnity who lives around the corner.</p>

<p>Then I bought a box of my favorites and smuggled
it into the house, feeling guilty, yet triumphant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>That night Clara, bless her heart, insisted on
opening the package and bringing me the first cigar,
which she lighted with her own dear hands.</p>

<p>Then she watched me puff my satisfaction.</p>

<p>It was genuine, I tell you, and mentally I was
patting myself on the back.</p>

<p>"How do you like them, my dear?" she asked,
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Prime&mdash;as good as any I've ever smoked," I replied,
honestly.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i034large.jpg"><img src="images/i034.jpg" width="400" height="328" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"I'm so glad, for you see I
had Mr. Harvesthome pick them
out for me. They cost fifteen
dollars for the box of fifty.
But I do
love to
see you
enjoy a
good cigar
after dinner."</p>

<p>Well, what do you think of that?</p>

<p>Harvesthome is the best judge of cigars I know.</p>

<p>Every time I pass McGinnity he calls out blessings
on my head for the "illegant" box of cigars I
gave him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>And I think Harvesthome suspects something.</p>

<p>That will cost me another box to keep him
hushed up.</p>

<p>I guess those were about the most expensive
common, everyday smokes I've ever indulged in.</p>

<p>Next year I will bribe Clara to let me help her
select the present.</p>

<p>But talking of smoking, I wonder whether it really
has any effect on the nerves, as the doctors claim.</p>

<p>Because, it's been my experience that some of
the nerviest chaps among the rising generation were
boys who indulged in cigarettes.</p>

<p>Why, just last week I had occasion to go to a
neighboring town down the coast.</p>

<p>It was confusing to a total stranger, the streets
ran at such queer angles.</p>

<p>So I determined to seek a little assistance.</p>

<p>There came along a sallow youth, puffing away at
a cigarette and looking
mighty important.</p>

<p>I held him up.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 353px;">
<a href="images/i035large.jpg"><img src="images/i035.jpg" width="353" height="323" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Say, young fellow, can
you direct me to the
bank?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Guess I kin, for a quarter,"
he replied, coolly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>I liked his nerve.</p>

<p>At the same time I expressed my surprise over
the steep demand he made for such a trifling
service.</p>

<p>"Huh," he said with a grin, "guess you can't
expect a fellow to be a bank director for nothing."</p>

<p>He got that quarter for his smartness.</p>

<p>If only one keeps his ears open on the streets he
is very apt to hear many queer things, and sometimes
fragments of humor go floating on the breeze.</p>

<p>Try it once.</p>

<p>You'll soon realize that after all, this is something
of a gay old world.</p>

<p>Down on Park Row, just as I was passing, an
irate customer was hauling a clothing dealer over
the coals.</p>

<p>"Say, Isaacson, you said this suit would wear like
iron," I heard the customer say.</p>

<p>The Jew
shrugged his
shoulders.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i036large.jpg"><img src="images/i036.jpg" width="400" height="234" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Vell, do
you mean to dell
me it did not?" he
asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hang it, too much like iron. I've only had it a
week, and see here how rusty it's become."</p>

<p>The same day I stopped to gaze at an astonishing
picture in front of a Fourteenth Street museum,
where the freaks are on exhibition day and night.</p>

<p>A wild-looking man came out and hurried away.</p>

<p>He was met by the manager, but broke loose and
walked down the street, evidently out of temper.</p>

<p>"See here," called out the proprietor to the man in
the ticket office, "what's gone wrong with the glass-eater?"</p>

<p>"Oh! he's struck."</p>

<p>"Wants more money, eh?"</p>

<p>"Nope, getting too toney, that's all."</p>

<p>"What's he up to, now?"</p>

<p>"Refuses what we give him&mdash;lamp chimneys ain't
fastidious enough for his highness&mdash;wants cut glass,"
said the man in the ticket office.</p>

<p>While I was still smiling about the stuck-up devourer
of broken glass, I ran slap into Godkin, who
used to be a neighbor of ours.</p>

<p>Some months back he yielded to the alluring
blandishments of the Jere Johnson tribe of suburban
real estate men, and went over in Jersey to reside.</p>

<p>He certainly looked bad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>His face was pale and his eyes had a far-away
expression.</p>

<p>"Old man," I said, anxiously, "what's ailing you? I
never knew you to be sick before. Really, you
ought to ask some doctor what's the matter."</p>

<p>"It's no use, I know it only too well. It's quick
consumption," he replied, with a sigh.</p>

<p>I was really distressed.</p>

<p>Godkin, bluff and hearty, was the last man I
should ever have expected to go into a decline.</p>

<p>"Quick consumption!" I repeated,
after him, and
laying a hand on his arm,
sympathetically.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i037large.jpg"><img src="images/i037.jpg" width="400" height="345" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Yes, having to bolt
my breakfast in two
gulps and hurry to catch the
train for town."</p>

<p>While I was talking with Godkin a nervous-looking
man passed us.</p>

<p>He had a lad along with him, and as it was a cold
day the boy kept knocking his hands together to induce
circulation.</p>

<p>This appeared to annoy grandpa.</p>

<p>"Tommy, stop rubbing your hands like that. The
weather's not cold."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>And Young America made reply:</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't tryin' to warm the weather&mdash;I'm a
warmin' my hands, see!"</p>

<p>I have good cause to remember that day.</p>

<p>It was a red-letter occasion.</p>

<p>I pride myself as being as smart as the next one,
and in a long experience seldom come out at the
small end of the horn.</p>

<p>But that day&mdash;it was a terrible blow to my pride.</p>

<p>An auction attracted
me.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i038large.jpg"><img src="images/i038.jpg" width="400" height="432" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I must confess
that I've a sneaking
liking for any stray
old bargain that may
be floating around.</p>

<p>I've got an attic
full of 'em at home
in the country&mdash;send
'em down there so my wife won't laugh at me.</p>

<p>However, up to this day, I don't think I've ever
been as foolish about bidding things in as Mrs. Gerrold,
who got a doorplate with the name Thompson
on it, and when I asked what use it could be to her,
calmly replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Life is very uncertain. Who knows, Gerrold
might be taken away and I might marry some man
named Thompson, and this would come in very
handy."</p>

<p>But I have purchased a white elephant.</p>

<p>You shall hear.</p>

<p>While prowling around in the auction room I ran
across a little antique chest.</p>

<p>It struck my eye as the very thing to keep my
papers in, and I thought I might squander a dollar or
so for it when the time came to bid.</p>

<p>When I turned back the lid I found the box half-filled
with packages of papers, some of which looked
like deeds.</p>

<p>Of course I was foolish to think of treasure-trove,
for who could say what valuable document a fellow
might not unearth among these bundles!</p>

<p>A seedy-looking chap touched me on the arm.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i039large.jpg"><img src="images/i039.jpg" width="400" height="247" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"I beg pardon,"
said he, "but
I hope you
won't bid
against me
on this here
chest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>"And why?" I asked, getting my back up at once.</p>

<p>"Because, you see, I used to be a coachman for
the family, and when they busted up they owed me
a part of my wages."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, and now you think there may be a
bonanza for you here. Well, I guess the track's free
to all, and I've taken a fancy to that chest myself,"
I said, firmly.</p>

<p>He shook his head and looked angry.</p>

<p>The box was put up the next thing.</p>

<p>I've often thought that queer.</p>

<p>That fellow hung on like a bulldog, to the extent
of his little pile, but my fighting blood was up, and if
I'd been a Vanderbilt I guess I'd have gone a
thousand.</p>

<p>I got it, though.</p>

<p>Locking the chest up I left it
while I went to the bank and borrowed
the money, some fifty-two
dollars.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 214px;">
<a href="images/i040large.jpg"><img src="images/i040.jpg" width="214" height="461" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Yes, that was an expensive box.</p>

<p>It seemed so precious that I squandered
another dollar and a half hiring a
cab to carry it home.</p>

<p>My wife thought I had been to a
funeral.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>A little later I was of the same opinion myself.</p>

<p>Those stocks and bonds just brought me twenty-two
cents for old paper.</p>

<p>Of course it was a set-up game, and they say a
sucker is born every minute.</p>

<p>That was my minute, probably.</p>

<p>But I am not always such an easy mark.</p>

<p>I dropped into a wholesale shoe house the other
day to see a friend.</p>

<p>Several of the salesmen were perched on boxes,
taking it easy, for business had slackened.</p>

<p>"Hello," I remarked, "all pulled for
the jury, I see."</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked one.</p>

<p>"Why, sitting on cases," I said.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i041large.jpg"><img src="images/i041.jpg" width="400" height="460" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Out in front I ran across two
excited Hebrews.</p>

<p>"You called me a dead beat,"
said one, angrily. "You
must take dot pack,
sir, or suffer dose consequences."</p>

<p>"I never dakes anydings pack," declared the other,
firmly.</p>

<p>"You don't dake noddings pack?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never. So help
me shiminy gracious."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i042large.jpg"><img src="images/i042.jpg" width="400" height="280" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"All right. You
vas der man I've
been looking for.
Lend me a haluf a tollar."</p>

<p>I hope he got it.</p>

<p>I had no time just then to wait and see, for I had
an errand to do downtown, a very particular one, too,
for Gwendoline.</p>

<p>That's my niece, who runs our flat just now.</p>

<p>You see, my brother left his little girl with us
while he ran across to London.</p>

<p>She's a dear little thing, but utterly spoiled.</p>

<p>Once in a while it is up to me to punish her, for I
promised Henry to be a father to his little pet while
he was gone.</p>

<p>The other night she was pouting and headstrong,
so I set about depriving her of something she particularly
desired.</p>

<p>Result, of course, a deluge of tears.</p>

<p>"It hurts me to see you cry, Gwendoline," I said,
in a mournful voice, "but you understand you can't
always have your own way, and do as you like."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, uncle," she sobbed, "how can you be so
obstinate?"</p>

<p>They're all alike, these women, and bound to gain
their ends by hook or by crook.</p>

<p>And yet sometimes they do have the most remarkable
ideas about things.</p>

<p>I was at a reception, and having wandered in the
conservatory thought myself alone, until I heard low
voices behind some shrubbery.</p>

<p>Of course a pair of turtledoves had secreted
themselves there to bill and coo&mdash;the cooing would
end at the altar, but every married man knows the
billing keeps right along.</p>

<p>Pretty soon I
heard the happy
youth say:</p>

<p>"Dearest, how
do you know that
you truly love me?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i043large.jpg"><img src="images/i043.jpg" width="400" height="470" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>And then she
answered innocently:</p>

<p>"Why, George, don't you see, ever
since I met you I've grown to admire
ears that stand out."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>When that girl gets married I don't think she'll
need any assistance in her household work.</p>

<p>We changed help the other day.</p>

<p>I hardly know what to make of the new girl.</p>

<p>Sometimes I labor under the impression that she
can be as dense as they make them across the water.</p>

<p>Then again she makes some remarks that stagger
me, and on my life I'm unable to decide whether
she's a fool, or takes me for one.</p>

<p>Her breaks are numerous.</p>

<p>Of course being newly landed she had never tasted
ice cream, and as the first spoonful went into her
mouth it came out again with violence, and tears
coming into her eyes, she gasped:</p>

<p>"Howly mither, it do burn!"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 304px;">
<a href="images/i044large.jpg"><img src="images/i044.jpg" width="304" height="448" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Why, it was only this morning
I wanted to consult my wife
about something or other.</p>

<p>Of course she could not be
found.</p>

<p>It's always thus.</p>

<p>But I am not the man to
complain.</p>

<p>With the determination that
has always distinguished my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
noble line of ancestry, I started in to search from
one end of the flat to the other.</p>

<p>This brought me to the kitchen, where lovely Nora
was diligently bending her back over the washtubs.</p>

<p>"Can you tell me of my wife's whereabouts?" I asked.</p>

<p>She looked puzzled, but only for a moment, and
then smiling broadly, said:</p>

<p>"Faith, to till yees the truth, I do belave they're in
the wash, sur."</p>

<p>However, I've run across some things that won't
wash.</p>

<p>We had a regular seance one night last week at
the house of a great friend of mine called Harper.
It was very interesting.</p>

<p>The professor who conducted the exercises was
a genius, and he came mighty near converting some
of the ladies to his extraordinary way of thinking.</p>

<p>I think Harper's wife was anxious to be a convert.</p>

<p>At any rate I heard her eagerly saying to the gentleman
with the long hair
and the occult eye:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 375px;">
<a href="images/i045large.jpg"><img src="images/i045.jpg" width="375" height="252" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"I have always believed
in dreams, professor."</p>

<p>"Ah!" said he, delighted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
"then perhaps you too have had some psychological
experience?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, I did&mdash;a most remarkable one in particular,"
she gushed.</p>

<p>"Prophetic?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I should greatly like to hear it."</p>

<p>"One night I dreamed that the sky suddenly blazed
with light; the heavens were filled with a thronging
host, a trumpet sounded, the dead arose from their
graves, and then a voice
shouted: 'Something terrible
is going to happen!'"</p>

<p>"Well?" he asked, "and it
came to pass?"</p>

<p>"Why, the very next day
our cook left."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 289px;">
<a href="images/i046large.jpg"><img src="images/i046.jpg" width="289" height="426" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I felt very sorry for the
professor&mdash;he laughed, of
course, but during the rest of
the evening I noticed he fought shy of Mrs. Harper's
company.</p>

<p>And the best of it was that lady actually believed
in the realization of her prophecy.</p>

<p>I know Harper thought it a dire calamity when
he had to subsist for a whole week on provender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
fashioned after the methods in vogue among cooking-school
graduates.</p>

<p>When he was a little younger Harper used to be
quite a clubman.</p>

<p>Habits of his bachelor days were hard to shake off.</p>

<p>I had often wondered how he came to suddenly
reform, and when my wife told me recently, as a
great secret, I have come to feel a new respect for
the fertility of resource as shown in the gentler sex.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harper used strategy, where another little
woman, less wise, might have tried expostulation
and entreaty without effect, for most men dislike
the tyranny of tears.</p>

<p>I'll tell you what she did.</p>

<p>Before going to bed she drew two easy chairs
close together by the parlor fire.</p>

<p>Then she took one of Dick's
cigars and held a match to it, until
the room got a faint odor of smoke.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 260px;">
<a href="images/i047large.jpg"><img src="images/i047.jpg" width="260" height="239" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Harper casually asked the next
morning who had dropped in and
looked at her in a funny way when she said
no one.</p>

<p>But he never went out another evening without
Mrs. Harper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, I call that as smart a bit of diplomacy as
Napoleon ever exhibited in his campaigns, don't you?</p>

<p>Harper lives in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>This gives him the privileges of a landed proprietor.</p>

<p>Why, think of it, the nabob even owns a reel of
garden hose, and when he comes home weary, in the
evening of a hot, dusty day, he can find relaxation to
body and mind by sprinkling the streets in front of
his house.</p>

<p>The first time I was over there, I found him taking
a turn at this thing.</p>

<p>There is a fascination about it, you know.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i048large.jpg"><img src="images/i048.jpg" width="400" height="296" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>At first I joked him unmercifully about it, but
wound up by offering
to show him a few
stunts in that line
which proved how I
had graduated as a
past master in the art.</p>

<p>While we were
chatting his little boy came along.</p>

<p>He seemed to be in tears about
something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's wrong, my son? I thought you had gone
with your mother on an errand," said Harper.</p>

<p>"She sent me home to change my stockings," he
blubbered.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter with them?"</p>

<p>"They's put on wrong side out."</p>

<p>"Hold on,"
I exclaimed,
"that's easily
remedied, if
you will permit
me," and
I turned the
hose on him.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i049large.jpg"><img src="images/i049.jpg" width="400" height="375" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>That little event brought to my
mind the narrow escape I had
recently.</p>

<p>Through the carelessness on the part of a gentleman
who was demonstrating the wonderful abilities
of his patent liquid fire extinguisher, my clothes
caught fire.</p>

<p>Well, that, you know, is no joke.</p>

<p>Many a poor chap has burned up before he could
collect his wits and roll himself up in a rug.</p>

<p>But I must confess, the fellow who was to blame
kept his head, and knew just what to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>He slapped a little stream of his magic mixture on
me, and before you could say Jack Robinson, I was
saved.</p>

<p>Of course he apologized.</p>

<p>I felt like thrashing him, but, as he was a brother
of my best friend, the pawnbroker, I forbore.</p>

<p>"I'm awful sorry, old boy," he said, "but no great
damage is done, and I hope you're not angry with me."</p>

<p>"No, but to tell you the truth, I feel awfully put
out," I replied.</p>

<p>Harper has another boy, about the age of my
youngest, and like all Brooklyn lads he is precocious.</p>

<p>He came in while I was there, crying
for keeps.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 166px;">
<a href="images/i050large.jpg"><img src="images/i050.jpg" width="166" height="351" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Hello, what's happened?" asked his
father.</p>

<p>"Been fightin' again."</p>

<p>"With that Irish boy, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yep, I'm bound to lick him yet."</p>

<p>"Well, you seem to have come out
second best this time. But what's the use crying&mdash;tears
do no good," said Harper, thinking to make him
more manly.</p>

<p>"All right," spluttered the boy as well as his cut
lip would allow him, "but I guess if you'd gone and
got whaled you'd blubber, too."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>Harper was telling me about Jerry's experience at
school. Jerry is the little chap who put his stockings
wrong side out that afternoon.</p>

<p>I thought it was rather a joke on Harper, though
he refuses to look at it that way.</p>

<p>Well, the teacher gave each of the little kids a
good, big healthy word to write down.</p>

<p>Then they were expected to look up the definition
in the dictionary, and write out a complete sentence
containing it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 347px;">
<a href="images/i051large.jpg"><img src="images/i051.jpg" width="347" height="392" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Jerry, he was given the word "anonymous,"
without a name, and when
the teacher read what he
had written on his strip of
paper, she thought it was
worth the while to send it
to Mr. Harper for denial.</p>

<p>This was Jerry's sentence:</p>

<p>"The new baby at our house is anonymous."</p>

<p>Still that was unintentional humor.</p>

<p>Nothing delights me more than to accompany a
friend on some afternoon excursion to the country.</p>

<p>This is especially true if he chances to be thinking
of finding a house in the suburbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Recently I performed this sad rite with Hollingsworth,
a legal friend of mine.</p>

<p>Among other places where he took me was a
town in Jersey which I dare not name for fear of
being lynched.</p>

<p>At any rate it was a dead herring.</p>

<p>Once a boom had set in, and streets were laid off
in the most extravagant fashion, but for years the
place had been going to the bad.</p>

<p>The real estate man had exhausted his resources,
and as a last card he said, desperately:</p>

<p>"But you certainly must admit that the town is
well laid out."</p>

<p>"Oh! we agree you've done the proper thing," I
remarked. "When a town is dead it's only right to
have it well laid out."</p>

<p>That real estate man was offended.</p>

<p>But then levity at a funeral is, I suppose, out of
place.</p>

<p>There was a dentist in the town who seemed to
have a little ambition, for he planted a sign in front
of his office bearing the legend:</p>

<p>"Teeth inserted for five dollars."</p>

<p>"I call that dear," I remarked.</p>

<p>"How so?" asked Hollingsworth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, I've got a brindle dog out
in the country that I'll guarantee to
do the job every time for nothing."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 228px;">
<a href="images/i052large.jpg"><img src="images/i052.jpg" width="228" height="210" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>While that real estate man was
showing us the beauties of the
broad fields we made an unfortunate acquaintance
with a gentleman cow.</p>

<p>Run&mdash;well, we did that everlastingly.</p>

<p>But the bull caught up with poor Hollingsworth.</p>

<p>I expected to see him gored to death.</p>

<p>That was when I forgot he was a lawyer, and
used to holding every charge.</p>

<p>He clutched Mr. Bull by the horns, and I hardly
knew whether to laugh or be frightened when I actually
saw him riding the beast.</p>

<p>Finally he was assisted over the fence.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i053large.jpg"><img src="images/i053.jpg" width="400" height="199" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>We hurried to him, anxious to learn whether he
had been injured seriously.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>Beyond a few scratches, and a tear or so in his
garments, he seemed to be all right.</p>

<p>Of course I warmly congratulated him on his abilities
as a prize bull-baiter.</p>

<p>He was a little dazed&mdash;I guess you would have
been, too, after such a warm experience.</p>

<p>"Say, am I awake&mdash;was this thing the genuine
article or did it only exist in my imagination?" he
asked.</p>

<p>I thought of how he rode that all bovine like a
Centaur, and hastened to reply:</p>

<p>"Well, if it wasn't real, it's certainly a striking example
of a man being carried away by his imagination,
that's all."</p>

<p>On the way home after that trip, Hollingsworth
was quite gay.</p>

<p>I've often wondered whether it came from his
being so well shaken up by the bull, or because he
had successfully evaded the snares of that smart
real estate agent.</p>

<p>"Did you notice it was a colored man who gave
our friend Joblots his letters at the post office?" he
asked.</p>

<p>I replied that I had been surprised to see that the
residents of a town in Jersey had a negro postmaster.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! he's only an assistant. But you'd be surprised
still more if you realized his real character."</p>

<p>"Would I?"</p>

<p>"Because everyone knows he's a blackmailer."</p>

<p>"That's serious, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"And it isn't the worst, either."</p>

<p>"Why, he must be a hard citizen&mdash;what else does

<p>"Joblots says his wife
takes hush money."</p>

<p>"Bribery, eh?"</p>

<p>"You see, she's one of
the nurses at the orphan
asylum."</p>

<p>By the way, before I
forget, I want to tell you
about a man I met this
morning. He followed the
funniest profession you
ever heard of.</p>

<p>He appealed to me for
help, saying times were
hard and he could find no employment at his profession.</p>

<p>"What are you?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"An oculist," he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked so seedy that I was surprised.</p>

<p>"An oculist, eh? How do you make that out?"
I asked.</p>

<p>"I take the eyes out of potatoes," he said.</p>

<p>Well, I got him a job as scullion in a beanery.</p>

<p>He had the whitest hair and mustache you ever
saw, and told me it had come in a night through a
scare, that he nearly died from fright&mdash;now do you
believe that?</p>

<p>Of course you do.</p>

<p>Why, more than once you've seen an old widower's
hair suddenly turn from gray to black about
five months after he buried the partner of
his joys and woes, and he didn't dye from
fright, either.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 126px;">
<a href="images/i055large.jpg"><img src="images/i055.jpg" width="126" height="264" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Say, did any of you people ever strike a
prohibition town?</p>

<p>Any of you that have done so will sympathize
with me, for I had a terrible experience of that sort
when on a tour last winter.</p>

<p>To save my life I couldn't get anything stronger
than Sparrowvinatis; that's a drink they have in
those freak towns.</p>

<p>Well, sir, I spied a braw Scotchman selling tickets
at a theatre door.</p>

<p>I gloated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>I made a bee line for him.</p>

<p>I plagued him with questions until he was the
maddest man in the United States.</p>

<p>Then I went away feeling better.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 230px;">
<a href="images/i056large.jpg"><img src="images/i056.jpg" width="230" height="357" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Yes, friends, if you ever get
stranded in a temperance town, do
as I did, stir up a little hot Scotch.</p>

<p>It'll do you good.</p>

<p>I went to a dinner in that same
town.</p>

<p>One fellow proposed a toast:</p>

<p>"May the trade of this town always
be trodden under foot!"</p>

<p>Drunk? Oh, no, he wasn't drunk. You see they
had a dozen big carpet manufacturies there, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Dear, dear, dear! Why, here's a hole in my coat.
That puts me in mind of Sunday school&mdash;you know
we learned long ago when we were good little boys
and went to Sunday school, that the prophet rent his
clothes. I guess he must have been a poor man
and couldn't afford to buy 'em. That's nothing
against old Elijah, is it?</p>

<p>Say, did you ever get up against the first-class
lunatic who is forever telling us about the city man's
smartness and the country man's dullness?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p>Let me tell you an experience of mine that gives
the lie direct to such an idea.</p>

<p>It happened one night as I was standing near the
ticket box of a swell Eastern theatre.</p>

<p>The play was "The Forty Thieves."</p>

<p>A big, raw-boned Jerseyman strode into the place,
as though he had made up his mind to squander
some of his hard-earned cash in order to see the
really gorgeous performance.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 271px;">
<a href="images/i057large.jpg"><img src="images/i057.jpg" width="271" height="409" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Sliding up to the box office I
heard him demand one of the
best seats and laid down a five-dollar
bill. A coupon and three
dollars was handed to him. When
he asked what the ticket cost and
was told that it was two dollars, it
was evident that he expected to pay
half a dollar at most.</p>

<p>"Two dollars to see the forty thieves, eh?" he
repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the box-office man.</p>

<p>"Well, keep your durned seat," exclaimed the man
from Jersey. "I don't think I care to see the other
thirty-nine."</p>

<p>Then there's the elevator boy in our apartment
house, who was born and brought up in the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p>He had a little flag pinned on his
coat, and I was joking him on his
patriotism.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 195px;">
<a href="images/i058large.jpg"><img src="images/i058.jpg" width="195" height="389" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"What have you ever done for your
country, Bill?" I asked.</p>

<p>Would you believe it, that urchin had
the nerve to look me wickedly in the
eye and say:</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I've raised a good
many families, sir."</p>

<p>On the train I met a man I used to know.</p>

<p>After we had been chatting about generations
a while, I asked:</p>

<p>"How about that wedding out in your town that I
saw mentioned in the papers&mdash;did it come off without
a hitch?"</p>

<p>"Well, I guess so."</p>

<p>"Everybody pleased, of course, as usual?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 276px;">
<a href="images/i059large.jpg"><img src="images/i059.jpg" width="276" height="324" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Everybody nothing, everybody
as mad as hornets, you mean.
The groom didn't show up, the
bride got screeching hysterics,
and the father's been prowling
round with a shotgun ever
since," said my friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"But see here&mdash;you said it went off
well?" I broke in.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 260px;">
<a href="images/i060large.jpg"><img src="images/i060.jpg" width="260" height="332" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"No, I didn't. You asked if it
went without a hitch and I
assented, for how could there be a
hitch without the bridegroom."</p>

<p>But, say, I must tell you about
being in court the other day.</p>

<p>The smart lawyer had the witness in hand, and it
appeared to be his plan of campaign to impeach the
man's testimony, by showing what a bad citizen
he was.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, very deliberately, "will you have
the goodness in conclusion, Mr. Gallagher, to answer
me a few questions; and be pleased to remember,
sir, that you are on your oath, and have sworn to tell
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sor," replied the witness, whom I
thought an honest-looking fellow, though hardly smart
enough to hold his own against a lawyer's search-light
methods.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Gallagher, we have reason to believe
that at the present time there is a female living with
you who is known in the neighborhood as Mrs.
Gallagher. Kindly tell the jury if what I say is true?"</p>

<p>"It is, sor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! yes, and Mr. Gallagher, is she under your
protection?"</p>

<p>"Sure."</p>

<p>"Now, on your oath, do you maintain her?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"And have you ever been married to her?"</p>

<p>"I have not."</p>

<p>The lawyer smiled just here, with the proud consciousness
of having rendered that man's testimony
not worthy of being taken into consideration.</p>

<p>"That is all, Mr. Gallagher, you may step down,"
he said.</p>

<p>"One moment, please," remarked the opposing
counsel; "with the permission of the court I would
like to ask a question."</p>

<p>"Granted," said the judge.</p>

<p>"Mr. Gallagher, remembering that you are on oath
to tell the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, be pleased to
state the relation which this objectionable
female bears to you."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 211px;">
<a href="images/i061large.jpg"><img src="images/i061.jpg" width="211" height="269" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"She's me grandmother, sure," said
Gallagher.</p>

<p>In Central Park I saw a policeman wheeling a
baby carriage, with the little cherub sound asleep
inside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>Possibly the nurse
had eloped with another
copper, and this chap
was taking the abandoned
infant to the station
that it might be
claimed.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i062large.jpg"><img src="images/i062.jpg" width="400" height="361" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Why are you arresting
a little child like that?" I asked the officer.</p>

<p>"Kidnaping," he said, with a grin, pointing to the
slumbering baby.</p>

<p>Don't look round but let me whisper. There's an
ancient couple at the back of the hall enjoying a
basket-lunch. That's what I call combining pleasure
with lunch. Now at the place where I dine we do
things differently. There we combine business with
lunch. The legend over the portals of the restaurant
reads:</p>

<p>"Business Luncheons."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i063large.jpg"><img src="images/i063.jpg" width="400" height="292" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I suppose they make that
candid announcement
because it's anything
but a pleasure to
make way with what
they serve there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>The other day when I dined there the waiter
came round and asked:</p>

<p>"What are you going to have?"</p>

<p>"I guess a beefsteak&mdash;but see here, waiter, not a
small one. I'm that nervous to-day every little
thing upsets me."</p>

<p>"Pardon me for asking, sir," said the waiter, between
the courses, "but what's made your eye black
and blue? Perhaps you've been having a little affair
with the gloves."</p>

<p>"Yes," I replied, carelessly; "I've been going
through an operation at the hands of a knockulist,
that's all."</p>

<p>Then I turned my attention to the roast chicken,
which reminded me of another affair.</p>

<p>You shall hear it.</p>

<p>Teddy O'Toole, who gave me so much amusement
last summer while I was sojourning in a mountain
town, has been at it again, I hear.</p>

<p>He is a sad case.</p>

<p>What do you think, his last trick was but to play
good old Father Ryan for a dinner.</p>

<p>Let me tell you the ingenious way the graceless
scamp went about it.</p>

<p>First of all, being hard set by hunger, what does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
he do but steal a fat young fowl from the priest's
henyard.</p>

<p>Having wrung its neck he presented
himself before the reverend
father, looking sadly repentant.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 245px;">
<a href="images/i064large.jpg"><img src="images/i064.jpg" width="245" height="401" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"What now, Teddy?" asked the
old man, who was growing weary
of wrestling with the devil as personified
in the vagrant.</p>

<p>O'Toole, with his head hanging
low, confessed that in an evil
moment he had stolen a fowl, and then, stung by the
lashing of his conscience, had come to confess his
wrong.</p>

<p>The father, of course, began to lecture him.</p>

<p>Then Teddy, as if desirous of doing penance,
offered the fowl to his reverence, which shocked
Father Ryan more, and he added to his words of
reproach.</p>

<p>"But faith, phat shall I do with the burrd at all?"
asked Teddy.</p>

<p>"First, return it to the owner."</p>

<p>"Indade and I've done the same, and be me sowl
he's actually refused to resave the purty creature."</p>

<p>"That is strange, and complicates matters. Stay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
there is one other chance left. Find some poor
widow who is in need, and present her with the
wretched bird."</p>

<p>"And thin will ye confess me?" demanded Teddy.</p>

<p>"Of a surety, since the good deed will have balanced
the evil one," returned the priest.</p>

<p>So away posted that miserable sinner to the house
of the Widow McCree, and she only too gladly
cooked the bird, since she had the fire handy.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i065large.jpg"><img src="images/i065.jpg" width="400" height="162" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Thus pooling
their resources
they fared merrily.</p>

<p>And I am
told on good authority that Teddy, determined to do
the thing up as it should be, presented himself before
the priest on the same evening, related how he had
given the fowl to a poor widow in need, and received
absolution as meekly as though he might be
but an erring saint instead of a scheming sinner.</p>

<p>His pranks always amuse me.</p>

<p>Though on more than one occasion I've found the
laugh didn't seem to come quite so spontaneously,
when the joke was on me.</p>

<p>This happened on a recent occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>I thought I had enough common sense about me
not to be caught by such a picayune piece of tom-foolery,
but no doubt at the time my mind was
wrestling with some of the weighty questions that
daily beset a professional man.</p>

<p>At any rate I fell an easy victim.</p>

<p>And I feel foolish every time I think of the affair.</p>

<p>There were seven gay boys in Snyders when I
entered, and having seen me coming, through the
glass door, they seemed to be engaged in serious
discussion.</p>

<p>"Here he is now&mdash;he can settle the argument
himself," said Tom Radcliffe.</p>

<p>"What's it all about?" I asked, innocently.</p>

<p>"Why, Craigie here said you understand German,
and I told him he was badly mistaken, and that I
didn't believe you could translate five words of it."</p>

<p>"Oh! well, I don't pretend to be a scholar, but I've
rubbed against some Teutons in my day, and may say
without egotism that I've conversed in German," I
replied, for it rather galled me to have Radcliffe
say that.</p>

<p>"Bosh!" exclaimed my detractor, "I've an idea the
simplest sentence would stump you. Say, what
does 'Was wollen Sie haben' mean, anyhow?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, what
will you have?"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i066large.jpg"><img src="images/i066.jpg" width="400" height="151" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Scotch for
me," said Radcliffe,
and the
others said that would suit them to a fine point.</p>

<p>But I don't believe they would have caught me so
easily if cares of state had not occupied my mind&mdash;you
see I was sitting on a new scientific joke, and
waiting for it to hatch.</p>

<p>Talking of science, I've found that it pays a man
to keep right up with the times.</p>

<p>By observing small things he is able to increase
his reputation among those who read less.</p>

<p>Let me prove this to you.</p>

<p>When that eclipse of the sun came I was down
among the mountains of North Carolina.</p>

<p>The district was a wild one, and they made considerable
moonshine whiskey round there, too; but
as I received no salary from the government for
looking after these mountain-dew men, I shut my
eyes to their little game.</p>

<p>You see I hadn't forgotten all the trouble they
gave my friend Bill Nye when he retired to these
North Carolina wilds to make up his funny books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>It occured to me that
I might have some fun
with the ignorant darkies
over the eclipse.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 363px;">
<a href="images/i067large.jpg"><img src="images/i067.jpg" width="363" height="362" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>So, meeting old Uncle
Lisha the day before, I
told him how his chickens
would all go to roost before
noon on the following day.</p>

<p>Of course the old fellow was incredulous, and just
as I supposed, circulated my prophecy round.</p>

<p>Well, now, I'm telling you there were some pretty
badly scared darkies in that section when it began to
get dark about eleven o'clock.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 311px;">
<a href="images/i068large.jpg"><img src="images/i068.jpg" width="311" height="140" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>And the fowls perched high
all right.</p>

<p>I never passed a cabin
after that, but every inmate ran to the door and
gaped after me in dumb admiration.</p>

<p>It was a great temptation to pose as a wizard,
but I was wise enough to forbear.</p>

<p>Something sudden sometimes happens to wizards
and other objectionable people down in that country.</p>

<p>Why, I remember one day seeing a poor woman
sitting outside her door, and crying while she dipped
snuff.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's the matter?" I asked.</p>

<p>"They's took my old man an' rided him on a rail,"
she said.</p>

<p>"That's bad."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 340px;">
<a href="images/i069large.jpg"><img src="images/i069.jpg" width="340" height="223" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"An' then they done
tarred and feathered him."</p>

<p>She wept copiously at
the memory.</p>

<p>My tender heart beat in sympathy with her.</p>

<p>"My good woman, I'm really sorry for you. It
must have been terrible hard," I said.</p>

<p>"It were," she cried. "They done took my best
feather bed."</p>

<p>But to return to the eclipse.</p>

<p>A few days later I ran across Uncle Lisha again,
and he took his hat off very humbly.</p>

<p>"Well, did it all happen as I said, uncle?"</p>

<p>"'Deed an' it did, sah, jest to de letter. 'Scuse me,
but did I understan' you to say, sah, dat you knowed
all about dat ting for a long time back dat it would
happen?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, quite a while, uncle," I replied.</p>

<p>"Mout it a ben as much as a yeah, sah?"</p>

<p>"Oh, two of them I'm certain," I replied, carelessly.</p>

<p>"Dat am shore a powerful queer ting," said the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
old man, scratching his head in perplexity as I rode
on, "case, you see, sah, dem chickens waunt eben
hatched den, and yet you knowed it all. Powerful
strange."</p>

<p>I might have talked all week and that old fellow
would never have understood.</p>

<p>I like to go househunting
with my wife.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 328px;">
<a href="images/i070large.jpg"><img src="images/i070.jpg" width="328" height="400" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Of course we keep on
living in the same place, but then she
has a periodical desire to better our
condition.</p>

<p>The last time we were out a relative
of hers who has always lived in
Jersey, mistress of her own lawn and
with plenty of room to swing a cat in her house, accompanied
us.</p>

<p>It was very funny.</p>

<p>That dear little woman gave the heartache to
many a lordly janitor before we wound up the day.</p>

<p>Her remarks were so refreshing.</p>

<p>Now, at the very first place we examined I heard
her give utterance to a genuinely feminine squeal of
delight.</p>

<p>"Why, isn't this just too cute for anything&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
dearest little linen closet I ever saw. Now, this is
what I call sensible," she said, enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said the agent, coldly, "but that is not
a linen closet, lady; that's the dining-room."</p>

<p>After that I watched Mrs. Suburb eagerly, for
somehow I conceived the idea that she was in for
a good time.</p>

<p>At another place there were limited accommodations,
and when my wife talked of putting Aleck to
sleep in the parlor on a wire couch, I entered my
solemn protest.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 384px;">
<a href="images/i071large.jpg"><img src="images/i071.jpg" width="384" height="282" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"The boycott is a relic of barbarism,"
I declared; and that settled our chances
of taking that flat.</p>

<p>Talking about flats and
moving, puts me in mind
of the long ago, when I
was a merry, light-hearted bachelor, not caring a rap
what the day brought forth.</p>

<p>Little I bothered myself about the price of spring
bonnets or how the crops promised.</p>

<p>Each day was sufficient unto itself, and brought
its joys and difficulties, but the tatler never weighed
heavily.</p>

<p>I've raised a family since, and my credit is still good.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>Thank you, I appreciate your encouragement, but
one experience will probably be quite sufficient
for me.</p>

<p>Now, during these halcyon days of yore, I remember
there was one dear old lady who seemed to take
the greatest interest in my welfare.</p>

<p>I often met her in the street, and she would even
stop to chat with me at times.</p>

<p>One day I was looking in at a
shop window.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 226px;">
<a href="images/i072large.jpg"><img src="images/i072.jpg" width="226" height="216" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I had a cigar box under my arm.</p>

<p>Just then, as luck would have it,
the old lady came up and greeted me.</p>

<p>She gave me a reproachful look.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you are smoking too much for your
health. I never see you now, without a cigar box
under your arm," she said, in her motherly way.</p>

<p>"Oh, it isn't that, I assure you," I hastened to declare,
"but the fact is, I'm moving again."</p>

<p>And speaking of those days, puts me in mind of
a little thing that happened to me about that time.</p>

<p>I was working as a reporter then, and the managing
editor complained that my material was quite too
far stretched.</p>

<p>That is, he said I cost them too much money in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
telegraphic tools, and desired me to condense
the details.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 188px;">
<a href="images/i073large.jpg"><img src="images/i073.jpg" width="188" height="395" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>They could do all the romancing at the
office, for we had men especially employed
for that purpose, who, given a
few facts for a foundation, could build
up the most astonishing account imaginable.</p>

<p>Indeed, I've known them to describe
things better than the fellow who was on the spot
could have done.</p>

<p>That's genius, you understand.</p>

<p>Well, I laid low and awaited my opportunity to
boil the next account down in a manner certain to
please this grand mogul.</p>

<p>The opportunity came.</p>

<p>There was some sort of explosion on a big vessel
over at Philadelphia, and as our regular correspondent
there chanced to be ill, I was packed off to get
special news.</p>

<p>"Be as quick as you can. Wire us hard, boiled-down
facts as soon as you get hold of 'em. Leave
details to the office. Perhaps you'll be in time for
the noon edition."</p>

<p>That's what the managing editor said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>I spared no expense
in hurrying to the spot,
and before eleven-twenty
sent this brief
telegram:</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 379px;">
<a href="images/i074large.jpg"><img src="images/i074.jpg" width="379" height="392" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<blockquote>
<p>"Terrific explosion.
Man-o'-war. Boiler empty.
Engineer full. Funeral to-morrow.</p>

<p class="right">Niblo."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would be hard to beat that for brevity. I believe
in brevity, even when a man is proposing to his
best girl.</p>

<p>Now there has always been considerable curiosity
manifested by my friends, who know my humorous
instincts, to know just how I ever popped the
question.</p>

<p>They declare, the chances are, I must have done
it in a joke.</p>

<p>Of course this doesn't refer to any lack of estimable
qualities in my wife, but simply that a fellow of
my character could not possibly do anything seriously.</p>

<p>I have determined to relate the facts in the case,
and they can judge for themselves.</p>

<p>You see, we had been down to the seashore together,
and, for the life of me, I couldn't muster up
courage enough to ask her the all-important question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>She gave me an opening at last, though perhaps
no one but a born humorist could have seen it.</p>

<p>Out on the rocks stood a gay old lighthouse,
which seemed to possess unusual interest in the
eyes of the young woman.</p>

<p>"It must be a lovely thing to live in such a weird
place. Sometime, before I die, I hope I may keep
a light house. I believe it would be lovely, don't
you?" she said.</p>

<p>Now, to tell the truth, the idea never occured to
me before, but when she spoke of it I saw my
chance.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i075large.jpg"><img src="images/i075.jpg" width="400" height="281" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"My dear girl,"
I said, "if I had
only known that
you cared for light house-keeping,
I would have spoken
before this. Let us discuss
the matter; what's the use
waiting until long in the
future, when the opportunity presents itself now."</p>

<p>And the result was, we pooled our issues, hired a
couple of rooms, bribed a minister to say a few
words, and kept house in a light way.</p>

<p>Since that time we've had our ups and downs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>But I've never felt toward my
better half as that old bear Podgers
must, with regard to the partner of
his joys and woes.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 224px;">
<a href="images/i076large.jpg"><img src="images/i076.jpg" width="224" height="305" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>He rode down with me in the
elevator yesterday.</p>

<p>We had been having a little domestic
trouble, and the lady in the kitchen had
wafted herself away.</p>

<p>This sometimes makes a man sad, especially if his
wife is seized with some of her old-time enthusiasm
and joyously declares she will look up those recipe
books, arranged at the time she went to cooking
school.</p>

<p>I knew I was in for another dose of dyspepsia
and had on my part been trying to remember the
dozens of patent medicines to which I had given a
trial on the last occasion, and which of them had
been least injurious.</p>

<p>Of course, man-like, I poured my woes into the
ear of Podgers, hoping for sympathy.</p>

<p>"Do you have any trouble keeping a cook?" I
asked.</p>

<p>He laughed in a cold-blooded way.</p>

<p>"Not in the least&mdash;not such good luck, my boy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
You see our cook has a lien on the
place. She's my wife," he said.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 202px;">
<a href="images/i077large.jpg"><img src="images/i077.jpg" width="202" height="401" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Well, I wouldn't have said that,
no matter what I thought.</p>

<p>But then Podgers always has been
considerably henpecked at home, even
if an arrogant chap downtown.</p>

<p>Sometimes he makes me think of
the meek little fellow I saw recently
in court.</p>

<p>He was a witness.</p>

<p>"Well," remarked the judge, "have you anything
to say?"</p>

<p>Then the witness looked fearfully about him, like
one long accustomed to knowing his place.</p>

<p>"That depends," said he,
"upon circumstance. Is&mdash;er&mdash;my
wife in the room, judge?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 283px;">
<a href="images/i078large.jpg"><img src="images/i078.jpg" width="283" height="250" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>While I am speaking of
marrying let me tell you about a fellow I
once knew.</p>

<p>His name was Steiner, and he set himself up in
business as an international marriage broker.</p>

<p>You see, these matches between broken-down
foreign noblemen and wealthy young American girls
gave him an idea that he might make a nice dot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>In due time he was employed by a German count
to secure an heiress for him.</p>

<p>The arrangement was that Steiner was to receive
ten per cent. of the young lady's estate for arranging
the match.</p>

<p>This looked like a snap, always providing
Steiner should succeed in finding
the heiress, and bring about an
understanding.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 184px;">
<a href="images/i079large.jpg"><img src="images/i079.jpg" width="184" height="214" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Well, he found the girl with the
ducats all right, but his price went up like bounds,
until, not content with ten per cent. of the estate
when a marriage was brought about, he asked for
the whole shooting match.</p>

<p>Yes, and he got it, too.</p>

<p>How was that&mdash;why, just as easy as two and
two make four. Steiner married the heiress himself.</p>

<p>Funny how one thing arouses a train of thought.</p>

<p>My wife brought home a curious Dutch stein after
one of her shopping excursions, and I never looked
at that affair without thinking of a certain graveyard
out in Western New York.</p>

<p>Let me tell you how that happens.</p>

<p>While visiting a friend, he took me to see the
sights of the place, and quite naturally we strolled
through the churchyard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>There were lots of old-timers buried there, and
some of the inscriptions quite interested me.</p>

<p>Presently we came to a new tombstone.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 256px;">
<a href="images/i080large.jpg"><img src="images/i080.jpg" width="256" height="366" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I noticed that above the inscription
there had been cut a single
hand, with the index finger pointing
upward.</p>

<p>It seemed appropriate enough
to me, and I was astonished
when my friend, after bending down to read,
actually laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, I declare," he said, presently, "if
that isn't just like old Stein. He never did order
more than one beer at a time!"</p>

<p>To the very last he was attached to his bier.</p>

<p>I remember it was in this same cemetery I ran
across a funny old darky who seemed to be examining
several traps which he had set.</p>

<p>Of course, my curiosity being aroused, I began to
fire a few questions at him.</p>

<p>If you ever want to find anything out, the best
way is to ask the why and wherefore.</p>

<p>What do you think he was after?</p>

<p>Rabbits, of course.</p>

<p>Then I remembered that down South it was all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the fashion for darkies to get the foot of a
graveyard rabbit, and carry it around with
them; they look on it as a sure thing to keep
bad luck away.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 219px;">
<a href="images/i081large.jpg"><img src="images/i081.jpg" width="219" height="377" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I thought I might convince the old fellow
of the absurdity of such mummery.</p>

<p>"See here, uncle, I'm afraid you're
a bit superstitious," I remarked.</p>

<p>"'Deed I isn'," said he, shaking his
white head. "Some folks is a skyaht of ghosses an'
all kin's of critters; but as long as I have a rabbit's
paw in mah pocket I feels
puffickly safe."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 357px;">
<a href="images/i082large.jpg"><img src="images/i082.jpg" width="357" height="157" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>After that I couldn't
say a word.</p>

<p>In fact, I felt as though speech were denied me,
as it is some unfortunate fellows.</p>

<p>If you ever ran across a man with a genuine impediment
in his speech, well, you know how painful it
seems to watch him nearly strangle in the endeavor
to make himself understood.</p>

<p>Advice is wasted on such a man.</p>

<p>I remember trying it once, only to get the cold
laugh.</p>

<p>Here's the story in verse.</p>

<p>Listen!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, be not hasty, friend?" I cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Think twice o'er all you utter."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I'm bound to do so," he replied,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"I stut-tut-tut-tut-tutter."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And I never hear any one carrying on in that way,
but what I think of an old Irishman, a farmer who
dropped into the office of a country weekly, run by a
friend of mine.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr. Dooley," said my friend, the editor.</p>

<p>Mr. Dooley took a chair.</p>

<p>"By the way, Mr. Dooley," said my friend, "you have
sent me a load of hay in payment for the five years'
subscription you owed me for my paper."</p>

<p>"Oi d-d-d-did," declared Mr. Dooley, nodding
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dooley, my horse
can't eat that hay."</p>

<p>Mr. Dooley screwed up his face, and puffed out
his cheeks until I thought he would
have a fit.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 236px;">
<a href="images/i083large.jpg"><img src="images/i083.jpg" width="236" height="246" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"T-t-t-to tell ye the t-t-truth,
mister, no more c-c-can m-m-me
g-g-go-go-goat e-e-eat your p-p-p-p-p-paper."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>I don't know which was hotter, Mr. Dooley or the
editor, when they finished their argument.</p>

<p>You realize there are various methods of warming
a man up&mdash;for instance, at my hotel one evening a
bell-boy came to the desk, after answering a call,
and said:</p>

<p>"That fellow up in 999 says he's freezing."</p>

<p>"All right," said the clerk,
cheerfully, "we'll soon have
him hot enough. Here, take
him up his bill."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 313px;">
<a href="images/i084large.jpg"><img src="images/i084.jpg" width="313" height="254" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I've got a great friend,
Henry Badger by name,
that I must tell you about.</p>

<p>I hardly know whether to admire the monumental
nerve of Henry Badger, or class him as a near relative
of the jackass tribe.</p>

<p>You may not know it, but his neighbors have long
been aware of the fact that his good spouse ruled
the roost with an iron rod, and Henry's former buoyant
spirit has all but withered in his breast.</p>

<p>Why, he used to strut the streets with all the
pompous airs of an alderman, while now he shuffles
along as though he owed ten tailors on the block.</p>

<p>It is awful, the change made in that man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>Once in a while I understand there is a faint glow
among the embers, and a trace of his old-time spirit
flashes up, though it is gone almost as quickly.</p>

<p>That must have been the case the evening I was
there.</p>

<p>Henry had been reading the evening paper, where
many black headlines announced the exciting events
of the day.</p>

<p>"One wife too many," I heard her say, sarcastically;
"that must of course refer to the doings of another
rascally bigamist."</p>

<p>"Not necessarily, my dear," returned Henry, without
daring to take his eyes off the paper.</p>

<p>I held my very breath with awe.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Badger, after
shooting him one quick
look, probably decided that
it was a blank cartridge.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 356px;">
<a href="images/i085large.jpg"><img src="images/i085.jpg" width="356" height="325" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Badger, when her back
was turned, actually gave
me a wicked wink behind
his paper.</p>

<p>On the whole, I guess there's a little of the old
spunk left, but it will never set the river afire.</p>

<p>Badger told me once, he and his wife ran away
and got married by a justice of the peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>If you never witnessed a civil marriage by an
alderman, a mayor, or some such officer authorized
to deal out bliss in double harness, well, you don't
know what you've missed, that's all.</p>

<p>The first time a magistrate has to officiate upon
such a happy occasion, one can hardly blame him for
being kind of nervous.</p>

<p>A good fairy sent me to the office of a friend,
who is a justice, and it happened he was tying his
first double knot.</p>

<p>Having been duly coached, he opened the proceedings
all right, and fancied he had plain sailing.</p>

<p>The woman had been duly asked whether she
would take the aforesaid man to be her husband, and
as that was the identical reason why she was there,
she hastened to say that
she had no objections, and
at the same time took a
firmer hold on his arm, as
though determined not to
let him get away from her.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 342px;">
<a href="images/i086large.jpg"><img src="images/i086.jpg" width="342" height="332" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Then the magistrate
turned to the groom and
pierced him with his eagle eye.</p>

<p>Perhaps he was so accustomed to having appeals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
made to him in his official capacity, that it came
very natural for him to remark:</p>

<p>"Prisoner at the bar, what have you to say in your
defense."</p>

<p>At the same time I thought it rather hard on the
young man, but he came up to the scratch smiling
and proved an alibi.</p>

<p>A magistrate's office is a good place for picking
up humor, but it doesn't compare with the den of an
installment book agent.</p>

<p>The manager of the office was hauling a candidate
for a position over the coals while I waited for
an interview, and quite a few amusing tidbits floated
over the top of the partition.</p>

<p>"Ever done any canvassing before, Mr. Jones?"</p>

<p>"Well, I worked a year in a Chicago house where
they packed hams for the market."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 232px;">
<a href="images/i087large.jpg"><img src="images/i087.jpg" width="232" height="397" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"You are a little hoarse this
morning&mdash;I hope your voice is reliable,
for you'll need it in this business."</p>

<p>"That's all right, the neighbors think I
got a good voice&mdash;they all advised me to
go abroad and study."</p>

<p>"You complained of having the toothache&mdash;will
that prevent you from carrying on business?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not at all, sir. You see it's a holler tooth."</p>

<p>By the way, this same manager of the Book
Agents' Supply Company has a most decided aversion
to all department stores.</p>

<p>He declares they are ruining the country.</p>

<p>That there is no longer a chance for a young man
to set himself up in business, and so forth.</p>

<p>You've heard the changes rung up on that story.</p>

<p>Possibly there's more or less truth about it; but
we've got to face a condition, not a theory.</p>

<p>Well, Babcock carries his hatred so far that he
detests the very sight and name of the department
stores. His wife has the strictest instructions not
to purchase anything whatever at these pernicious
paradises, and, therefore, when he returned to his
home early one day last week and discovered a parcel
of groceries on the hall table which bore the
hated imprint of Swindell &amp; Getrich, great and tremendous
was his virtuous wrath.</p>

<p>His knife was out in an instant, and in another
the various packages were ripped up, and condensed
milk, eggs, tea, sugar, and the sultanas were mixed
together in a fearsome heap on the linoleum.</p>

<p>"Why, what are you doing, Henry?" said his wife,
entering at that moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>Rip, went another
packet of
Scraped Nutshells
for Scraggy Nonentities,
and whizz
went its contents.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;">
<a href="images/i088large.jpg"><img src="images/i088.jpg" width="400" height="361" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"I'm teaching you a lesson,
madam!" he roared. "Teaching
you to obey my instructions
not to deal at this store?"</p>

<p>"Why, Henry," said the lady, "they don't belong to
us at all. Mrs Jenkins, next door, has gone away
for the day, and I promised to take them in for her."</p>

<p>And Babcock had to subdue his spleen, allow his
wife to hie away to the hated department store and
duplicate the whole Jenkins' order.</p>

<p>He is also a singular man, in that he will not allow
himself the pleasure of a good cigar.</p>

<p>Some men would make good Mohammedans, for
they always seem trying to deny themselves the
good things of life&mdash;a sort of crawling to Mecca on
their knees.</p>

<p>Why, what do you think, while Babcock and myself
were sauntering through Central Park recently,
up runs a smart little urchin, and sings out:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Box o' matches, sir?"</p>

<p>"No," said Babcock, loftily, "don't
smoke."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 219px;">
<a href="images/i089large.jpg"><img src="images/i089.jpg" width="219" height="405" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Well," remarked the boy, sympathetically,
"if you'll buy a box,
guv'nor, I don't mind teachin' yer."</p>

<p>As we sauntered along we came
upon a diminutive girl who was
wheeling a perambulator, in which
was a very young child.</p>

<p>As the vehicle was being pushed dangerously near
the edge of a somewhat steep curb, I was alarmed,
and ventured to faintly remind her that the little one
was in danger of being thrown out.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 318px;">
<a href="images/i090large.jpg"><img src="images/i090.jpg" width="318" height="294" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>The girl looked up in my
face, and, in a tone of utter
and complete indifference,
replied:</p>

<p>"It don't matter, mister; it ain't our kid."</p>

<p>And it was on the same afternoon
that I saw an amusing mix-up, as well
as had my recollection of a life upon the ocean
wave revived.</p>

<p>An old salt, who had apparently learned to navigate
a bicycle fairly well, was working his wobbly
way along one of the paths in the park, when, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
our eyes, he collided with
a lady wheeler.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 305px;">
<a href="images/i091large.jpg"><img src="images/i091.jpg" width="305" height="390" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>It was awfully funny, I'm
telling you, now.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there was no
personal damage, and he hastened
to murmur his excuses.</p>

<p>"I'm sure as I ought to be scuttled for
it, mum," he said, apologetically, "but I
couldn't get your signals no more as if we were feeling
through a fog bank. I was blowin' for you to
pass to port an' steerin' my course accordin'. Just
as I was going to dip my pennant an' salute proper,
your craft refused to obey her rudder, an' you struck
me for'ard. Afore I could reverse, your jib-boom
fouled my starboard mizzen riggin', your mainsail
(skirt) snarled up with my bobstay, parted your
toppin' lift, and carried away
my spanker down haul. As I
listed to try to jib, I capsized,
keel up, an' put you flounderin'
in the wreckage. I hope you'll
forgive me, mum, and let's start
off fresh, on a new tack."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 290px;">
<a href="images/i092large.jpg"><img src="images/i092.jpg" width="290" height="373" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Now, I liked that old tar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>He was a square-rigged man, and ready to
accept what the gods sent him.</p>

<p>That's my style.</p>

<p>I've got my faults, but kicking isn't one of

<p>You'll always find me at the same old
stand, ready to take things as
they come&mdash;but please be a little
careful about the antiquity of the
eggs, because, you see, I've got
my best clothes on.</p>

<p>Now, if the orchestra will kindly
wake up and give us a little music,
I'll try and sing a song which I have
called "No Kicker Need Apply."</p>

<p>Hold on, professor, you want to be
sharp. I expected you'd be flat, so I guess you'd
better compromise and only be natural.</p>

<p>Well, then, here goes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Guess I've been about as lazy as the civil laws allow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know blame well I've been as lazy as I could be anyhow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never liked t' do th' milkin', never liked t' heft a hoe,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Never liked to plow or harvest, never liked t' reap ner sow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never was much good at nothin' that my daddy put me at,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I've never been a kicker, an' I'm bloomin' glad o' that.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There isn't any chorus to this song, so glide right
along to the second verse, professor. Here you are.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I've been called a triflin' beggar, I've been called a shif'less slouch;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've been called some things that hurt me, but I never hollered "Ouch!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've left undone a heap o' things I started out to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' I've had my share of headache&mdash;yes, I've had my share, f'r true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my upper lip's kep' stiffer'n any board ye ever see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fer I've never been a kicker, an' I'm never goin' t' be.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I've seen days when clouds was hangin' over ev'rything in sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've seen times I wished t' goodness, morning wouldn't foller night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've felt kicked an' snubbed an' slighted&mdash;though folks didn't mean it so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' I've had to blink an' swaller for t' make my smiler go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I made it work, by ginger, and I'm thankful for it still&mdash;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Fer I've never been a beefer, an' you bet I never will.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I've been watchin' folks that hollered till they's purple in th' face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Claimin' that their nat'ral enemies was all th' human race.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kep' on noticin', and purty soon their guess was blame near right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they al'ays was commingled in some sort o' gen'ral fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thankful I don't see things that way, though I'm not no haloed saint;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I've never been a kicker, an' I'm mighty glad I ain't.<br /></span>

</div>

<p>Thank you ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>I knew the noble sentiments expressed in those
verses would take your hearts by storm.</p>

<p>And please forbear showing your appreciation by
the customary liberal supply of ancient hen fruit, tomatoes,
and cabbage flowers.</p>

<p>I want you to understand that this is no donation
party.</p>

<p>You doubtless saw that I was a little horse&mdash;in
other words, that I have something of a colt this
evening.</p>

<p>Now, I'm pretty good at making excuses myself,
but I give the cake to Reddy Moriarty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>You see, he's a fellow working on the subway,
under an old friend of mine, a Maj. Dickerson.</p>

<p>Just while I was interviewing the contractor the
other morning, who should come along but Moriarty.</p>

<p>The foreman was mad clean
through, and I thought only
Reddy's ready Irish could
save him from a hauling over
the coals.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 320px;">
<a href="images/i095large.jpg"><img src="images/i095.jpg" width="320" height="362" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>It did the same, by the
powers.</p>

<p>"Nine o'clock!" snarled the
foreman, "what d'yer mean by coming at this time of
day? It's a wonder a man of your independence
troubles himself about coming at all. Now, then,
what's your excuse?"</p>

<p>Moriarty considered a moment, and at last the
excuse came.</p>

<p>"Sure, sor," he said, "I dramed last night I was at
a baseball match, betwane the giants and the Champions,
that ended in a tie. So the umpire ordered
extra innings to be played, and, begorra, sor, I only
stopped to see the finish!"</p>

<p>Moriarty was once a pilot.</p>

<p>"Faith," says he to me, "time was when I piloted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
all kinds of ships into harbor,
but I've redooced it all down
to a system, and the only sort
I take over the bar now is
schooners sor."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 279px;">
<a href="images/i096large.jpg"><img src="images/i096.jpg" width="279" height="438" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>But I musn't forget to tell
you about my friend, old Dr.
Raggles.</p>

<p>I always refer to him as "that
old war horse." You'd know
why, if you cast your eye over that last bill he sent
me. As a charger he'd be hard to beat.</p>

<p>The doctor took a day off recently and ran up to
a country town to see a family horse that was
for sale.</p>

<p>He tried the beast, fancied him, paid a stiff price
for the outfit, and rode off happy.</p>

<p>Three hours later he came back mad.</p>

<p>"Look here, sir!" he
yelled, "this darned old
horse won't do for me.
He shies. I can't get him
to cross the bridge."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 339px;">
<a href="images/i097large.jpg"><img src="images/i097.jpg" width="339" height="308" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"That's why I sold him,"
said the dealer. "Didn't
I advertise my reasons for selling him?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; 'to be sold,' you stated, 'for no other reason
than that the owner wanted to get out of town.'"</p>

<p>"Well," says the dealer, "if you can get out of
town with him, it will be more than I can do!"</p>

<p>Say, I went on the road with a post office inspector
last year.</p>

<p>First post office we struck, a big, strong Irish
woman was behind the counter.</p>

<p>"Ahem!" said the inspector. "I thought a man
was in charge here!"</p>

<p>"Begorra, ye're roight, he was," said the lady;
"but Oi married him, an' Oi'm in charge now. Pfwat
is it yez want?"</p>

<p>She was a Tartar, I
tell you.</p>

<a href="images/i098large.jpg"><img src="images/i098.jpg" width="397" height="262" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>I wonder what Mr.
Man was doing. Maybe
he had the cradle
to rock.</p>

<p>I was in jail last month. Oh, only as a visitor,
of course. I needn't explain that. Went the
rounds of the cells with the governor of the
State.</p>

<p>Well, we struck one man who was the homeliest
specimen of humanity I've ever seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you here for?" says the governor.</p>

<p>"For runnin' away with a
woman, yer honor!" says the
man.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 262px;">
<a href="images/i099large.jpg"><img src="images/i099.jpg" width="262" height="326" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>"Bless my soul!" says the
governor, "is that so? I must
send you a pardon. I don't see
how a man so homely as you
could ever get a wife unless he ran away with
one."</p>

<p>A cage or two farther on was occupied by a big,
husky chap.</p>

<p>"What are you here for?" says the governor.</p>

<p>"I'm here for my health, governor," says the
man.</p>

<p>"How's that?" asks the governor.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, I had six wives,
governor."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 261px;">
<a href="images/i100large.jpg"><img src="images/i100.jpg" width="261" height="374" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p>Well, no pardon dropped in on
that chap.</p>

<p>He had seized just six times
his share.</p>

<p>A few more like him and the
women wouldn't go around.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>Jiminy Christmas! There's the gong of my
auto. My chaffeur's getting impatient. Yes, my
time is up. I got ten dollars advanced on it
yesterday.</p>
